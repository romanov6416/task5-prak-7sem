# It is wise to understand the diagram listed in the task explanation before starting to look code
# It is also wise to follow recomindations listed at the very end of the file
# Start analysing comment from function "Run" and after that - look functions bottom to top

# You will also have to change code in
#   1) function LoadAlgConf in MainWindow class in MainWindow.py file
#   2) function Run in MainWindow class in MainWindow.py file
#   3) function retranslateUi in GUI.Windows.ui_MainWindow.py
#   4) function setupUi in GUI.Windows.ui_MainWindow.py

# All data you need about system is stored in python classes:
#   1) Module
#   2) System
#   3) Constraints
# You can find in them reliabilities, costs, etc
